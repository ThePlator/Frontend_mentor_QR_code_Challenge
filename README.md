## My process

1. creat a div of class-name: card then center that div by giving the margin: 10rem(top/bottom) auto(left/right) and gave the width of 25rem and height 37.5rem and the background-color White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%).
2. Add img and the width and height is 23.75 and 25 respectivly and the margin: 1.25rem 0 0 0.625rem.
3. I gave the marging of 1.875rem to the left and right and align the text in center.
